## Data use: 


## Summary:

Data for 3 penguin species (Chinstrap, Adelie, & Gentoo) have been combined into a single CSV, **penguins_lter.csv**. A simplified subset **penguins_size.csv** is also included, which contains four penguin size measurements (culmen length, culmen depth, flipper length, and body mass) for the 3 species, along with island and sex. 

Here is an example graph using the data:
