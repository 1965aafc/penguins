# Palmer Station LTER Penguin data

Data are generously collected and shared by Kristen Gorman et al. from the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER (a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network). 

Data for 3 penguin species (Chinstrap, Adelie, & Gentoo) have been combined into a single CSV, **penguins_lter.csv**. A simplified subset **penguins_size.csv** is also included, which contains four penguin size measurements (culmen length, culmen depth, flipper length, and body mass) for the 3 species, along with island and sex. 

Here is an example graph using the data:
