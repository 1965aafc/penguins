# Palmer Station LTER Penguins

Data are generously collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/). 

Thank you Dr. Gorman, Palmer Station LTER and the LTER Network! See full citation and data information below. 

## Summary:

Data for 3 penguin species (Chinstrap, Adelie, & Gentoo) have been combined into a single CSV, **penguins_lter.csv**. A simplified subset **penguins_size.csv** is also included, which contains four penguin size measurements (culmen length, culmen depth, flipper length, and body mass) for the 3 species, along with island and sex. 

Here is an example graph using the data:

## Original data access and use: 

From Gorman et al.: "Data reported here are publicly available within the PAL-LTER data system (datasets #219, 220, and 221): http://oceaninformatics.ucsd.edu/datazoo/data/pallter/datasets. These data are additionally archived within the United States (US) LTER Network’s Information System Data Portal: https://portal.lternet.edu/. Individuals interested in using these data are therefore expected to follow the US LTER Network’s Data Access Policy, Requirements and Use Agreement: https://lternet.edu/data-access-policy/."

Anyone interested in publishing the data should contact [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) about analysis and working together on any final products.
