# Palmer Station LTER Penguins (in progress)

Data are generously collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/). THANK YOU Dr. Gorman, Palmer Station LTER and the LTER Network! Special thanks to Marty Downs (NCEAS) for help regarding license & use!

Data are available by [INSERT LICENSE INFO HERE]. 

See complete data information & citations below.

## Summary:

The data folder contains two CSV files: 

- **penguins_size.csv**: Simplified penguin data containing four penguin size measurements (culmen length, culmen depth, flipper length, and body mass) for the 3 species (Chinstrap, Adélie, & Gentoo), along with island and sex. *This is probably the one you want to use for intro classes & examples, especially if you're using it instead of iris dataset.* 

- **penguins_lter.csv**: original data (including isotope measurements from blood samples)

Feel free to use the illustrations below for your teaching materials (Artwork: @allison_horst).

### Example graphs using the data:

#### Flipper length vs. body mass

#### Culmen dimensions Simpson's paradox example?

#### Opportunities for comparisons between groups

There are a number of questions you could ask about means comparisons, spread, effect size, etc. Here are a couple histograms to consider.

## Original data access and use: 

From Gorman et al.: "Data reported here are publicly available within the PAL-LTER data system (datasets #219, 220, and 221): http://oceaninformatics.ucsd.edu/datazoo/data/pallter/datasets. These data are additionally archived within the United States (US) LTER Network’s Information System Data Portal: https://portal.lternet.edu/. Individuals interested in using these data are therefore expected to follow the US LTER Network’s Data Access Policy, Requirements and Use Agreement: https://lternet.edu/data-access-policy/."

Anyone interested in publishing the data should contact [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) about analysis and working together on any final products.
